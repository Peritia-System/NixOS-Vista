Just used to make some Showcasing/Developing 

If you wanna use it make sure to click "View" -> "Grab on Hover" so you can use the SUPER key 


# For Developing: 
If you add any configurations/options to nixosVista then always write the example/showcase code to ./nixosVista.nix
Always write the Default option

If for showcasing it makes sense to use a custom option (like a wallpaper or a Monitor name) then write it to ./nixosVista-custom.nix

To make Showcasing as Attractive as possible: Use only the most nessecarry programms or Programms that are relevant for basic Desktop use/important for the theme Showcase
That way it doesn't bloat the nix-store of the people running it
